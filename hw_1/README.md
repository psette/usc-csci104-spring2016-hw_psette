- **PROBLEM 4**
Program will run on the second thing inputted in the command line. It will not run if there is no second input, it will just output an error message of "Check Input"

- **PROBLEM 5**
AN INTEGER MUST BE ONTOP OF THE FILE
Program will only allocate an array the size of the first number, so if the first number is larger than the number of ensuing words, the program will wait for more inputs and lag. Also, if the first number is smaller than the number of ensuing words, the program will only run with the first number of words.

- **PROBLEM 6** 
PROGRAM INPUTS MUST BE UPPERCASED.

ALL NUMBERED INPUTS ARE INTEGERS.

For a command to be considered valid it must be onthe same line. For example:
MOVEIN i k
is valid, whereas
MOVEIN i
k
is not.

For OBTAIN i j k n1 n2 n3 ... nk, k cannot be less than thenumber of folowing object. K can be more than the number of following strings, although the student will only obtain k strings.
