Done, in full, in the hw2.txt file

- **PROBLEM 6**
merge.cpp contains a function (without a main) that will merge(in order) two sorted linked lists, recursivley. There are also comments right after the code.

- **PROBLEM 7** 
llistint.cpp contains the code for methods for linked list. The functions I completed are insert, remove, and getNodeAt. Each line of code has a comment right after.

- **MAKEFILE** 
Makefile is included and on make, it runs the test cases

- **test.cpp** 
A handful of test cases for each individual function (insert, remove, and getNodeAt).
